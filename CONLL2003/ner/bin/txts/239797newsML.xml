<p>Maya Indian groups and human rights organizations said Friday they would joyfully celebrate the end of Guatemala's civil war but also planned to monitor closely the implementation of peace accords.</p>
<p>A group of influential grass-roots leaders said they were forming a network of committees nationwide to keep an eye out for and investigate any continuation of human rights abuses that have plagued Guatemala for more than three decades.</p>
<p>The government and Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) rebels will sign a historic agreement this month bringing an end to Central America's longest and only continuing guerrilla rebellion.</p>
<p>The signing, putting into effect 11 separate accords covering everything from indigenous rights to army reductions, will take place in the seat of government, the National Palace, in the capital.</p>
<p>&quot;We will put on a march which will move towards the central plaza (in front of the palace) and join an all-night vigil on the night of the 28th. We are also planning to celebrate a Maya ceremony that day,&quot; Miguel Sucuqui, coordinator of the Runujel Junam Ethnic Communities Council (CERJ), said.</p>
<p>He said the council and other members of the National Human Rights Coordination Committee (Conadehgua) were urging rural Guatemalans to celebrate the signing in their villages. &quot;We're calling on the people to come into the centers of their towns, to go out on the highways, to set off firecrackers and to gather together to celebrate.&quot;</p>
<p>Members of the committee also announced they were beginning to establish voluntary committees in different provinces to collaborate in investigating reports of human rights abuses and to watch for continuing abuses.</p>
<p>&quot;We are calling on the rank and file and on the people in general to organize themselves to defend and to keep an eye on the fulfillment of the peace accords,&quot; Sucuqui said.</p>
<p>He said grass-roots groups were particularly concerned that armed paramilitary patrols will continue to intimidate rural Guatemalans. CERJ fears the army has not, as advertised, completely demobilized and disarmed the Civil Self-defense Patrols in which villagers served as the military's eyes and ears in rural areas.</p>
<p>&quot;For us this is a threat to the peace we are waiting for. No competent authority will have control over these groups and it could cause an increase in common crime,&quot; Sucuqui said.</p>
