U.S. Nov jobs signal modest growth, wages a worry.

U.S. non-farm payrolls rose less than expected in November, hinting that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, analysts said.

But a firm increase in average hourly earnings suggests that the tightness in the labor markets portends possible higher wage inflation next year, they added.

"The data tell us we have moderate growth ... And at the moment low inflation, but there is the potential again for a bit of a pickup next year, a gradual sustained pickup," said Lee Youngdahl, vice-president at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.  

The Labor Department said on Friday that November non-farm payrolls rose by 118,000 against a revised 224,000 rise in October. The number came in below the market's expectations for a 179,000 increase.

The unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in the previous month. Analysts had expected the rate would remain unchanged in November.

Average hourly earnings jumped to $11.99 in November against $11.90 in the previous month. "We did get a increase in hourly earnings," said Michael Niemira, economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.  

"What we might be seeing is kind of a late cycle phenomenon where employment starts to slow and wages start to pick up a little and ultimately (it) could be bad news down the road," the BTM economist added.

Some analysts said, however, the rise in average hourly earnings must be taken with a grain of salt. Although the nominal index was up in November, they said wages continued to trend down.

"Even given the increase in average hourly earnings, wages and salaries are trending down," said Kathy Bostjancic, money market analyst at UBS Securities.  

"We had (wage) growth of over 8.7 percent in the second quarter, 6.3 in the third quarter and we're sitting about 4.0 percent or so in the current quarter," she added.

The November employment numbers were not seen as enough reason to prompt the Federal Reserve to change the course of monetary policy in the U.S. in the near future.

Analysts said, however, the report served as a warning to those who are predicting the next Fed move is going to be an easing of interest rates.  

"I think that anybody that was getting the notion that the next Fed move will be an easing should put that on the backburner," Aubrey's Youngdahl said. "These wage numbers clearly do not point toward that eventuality."

The employment report, one of the most closely watched economic indicators on Wall Street, also played a role in the financial markets on Friday.

The U.S. Treasury market, which had dropped sharply overnight after some comments by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, pared some of its losses after the payroll report release.

The 6-1/2 percent benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was quoted down 20/32 at 99-09/32, after falling about 1-11/32 at the opening on Friday. Its yield was at 6.54 percent.

U.S. stock prices opened down after Greenspan's remarks, which included a warning against exuberance in U.S. asset markets. The Dow Jones Industrials were down well over 100 points in early trade.
