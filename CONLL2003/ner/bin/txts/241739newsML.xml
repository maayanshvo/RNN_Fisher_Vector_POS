<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodian PM says intimidation could mar elections.</title>
<headline>Cambodian PM says intimidation could mar elections.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1996-12-07</dateline>

<p>Cambodian co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said on Saturday that intimidation of his royalist FUNCINPEC party and a leading opposition party could taint national elections scheduled for 1998.</p>
<p>When asked about reported intimidation, he said: &quot;Yes, members of FUNCINPEC, members of KNP (Khmer Nation Party) as well. If we continue like this, it will not be a free and fair election at all.&quot;</p>
<p>The prince made the statement as he left a charity event held at the former headquarters of UNTAC, the United Nations mission that sponsored national elections in 1993.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate on who was intimidating the parties, but human rights workers have reported incidents of members of the ex-communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP) threatening people in the provinces if they did not join the CPP.</p>
<p>The CPP is headed by co-Premier Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Om Yentieng, a spokesman for Hun Sen, said the CPP only wanted peace and said FUNCINPEC was provoking conflict with false accusations of political intimidation.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hun Sen resolves problems with peace,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the first prime minister knows very well what he is doing...From this, you can understand who is the first to provoke the attacks, including the army attacks also,&quot; he added, referring to several recent clashes between government soldiers from the two parties.</p>
<p>A Human Rights Watch/Asia report released on Friday cited reported harassment of FUNCINPEC officials and political violence against the opposition KNP of former finance minister Sam Rainsy.</p>
<p>Hun Sen and Ranariddh, who formed an uneasy coalition government following U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, have been at odds over issues ranging from power sharing to the recruitment of defecting Khmer Rouge guerrillas.</p>
<p>The two leaders will likely oppose each other in the next national elections in 1998.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge, whose brutal 1975-79 &quot;killing fields&quot; rule left more than one million dead, have been weakened by a wave of defections in recent months.</p>
<p>Winning the loyalities of several thousand defectors has become a key focus for Hun Sen and Ranariddh.</p>
