<headline>Frankfurt shares seen rebounding on Dow bounce.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>German shares were expected to bounce back on Monday in response to Wall Street trimming back its opening loss, Frankfurt traders said.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX held steady at 2,824.12, down 70.31 points, but well up from its intra-day low of 2,759.68. The German index climbed back over 2,800 as the Dow Jones average slumped more than 150 points and then recovered to 6,353.99, down 83.11.</p>
<p>&quot;The sell-off in Germany was factoring into the Dow, but now the Dow has bounced so we should have a nice little squeeze on Monday,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Hardest hit on the DAX were export-heavy shares such as the chemical groups pressured by the dollar dipping to 1.53 marks from 23-month highs around 1.56.</p>
<p>In IBIS trading, BASF AG was down 2.65 marks, or 4.25 percent, to 58.60 marks, while Bayer AG fell 2.19 marks to 62.05. Hoechst AG fell 1.68 marks to 67.95.</p>
<p>Industrial group Mannesmann AG, which rose on Thursday on rumours of a telecommunications alliance, retreated 18 to 643 marks, but up from a low of 640.</p>
<p>Frankfurt economists also said German shares still have room to grow through the end of the year.  </p>
<p>&quot;We could go even lower on Monday after we see how the U.S. market reacts,&quot; said a Bank Julius Baer economist.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse still has upward momentum because German profits are still climbing and the German market as a whole could be even more attractive if other markets fall,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other economists called Friday's fall a healthy correction, saying the DAX had climbed too quickly in its 100-point ascent to the 2,900 point level in the last week.</p>
