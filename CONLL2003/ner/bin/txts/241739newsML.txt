Cambodian PM says intimidation could mar elections.

PHNOM PENH 1996-12-07

Cambodian co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said on Saturday that intimidation of his royalist FUNCINPEC party and a leading opposition party could taint national elections scheduled for 1998.

When asked about reported intimidation, he said: "Yes, members of FUNCINPEC, members of KNP (Khmer Nation Party) as well. If we continue like this, it will not be a free and fair election at all."

The prince made the statement as he left a charity event held at the former headquarters of UNTAC, the United Nations mission that sponsored national elections in 1993.

He did not elaborate on who was intimidating the parties, but human rights workers have reported incidents of members of the ex-communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP) threatening people in the provinces if they did not join the CPP.

The CPP is headed by co-Premier Hun Sen.

Om Yentieng, a spokesman for Hun Sen, said the CPP only wanted peace and said FUNCINPEC was provoking conflict with false accusations of political intimidation.

"Mr Hun Sen resolves problems with peace," he said.

"I think the first prime minister knows very well what he is doing...From this, you can understand who is the first to provoke the attacks, including the army attacks also," he added, referring to several recent clashes between government soldiers from the two parties.

A Human Rights Watch/Asia report released on Friday cited reported harassment of FUNCINPEC officials and political violence against the opposition KNP of former finance minister Sam Rainsy.

Hun Sen and Ranariddh, who formed an uneasy coalition government following U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, have been at odds over issues ranging from power sharing to the recruitment of defecting Khmer Rouge guerrillas.

The two leaders will likely oppose each other in the next national elections in 1998.

The Khmer Rouge, whose brutal 1975-79 "killing fields" rule left more than one million dead, have been weakened by a wave of defections in recent months.

Winning the loyalities of several thousand defectors has become a key focus for Hun Sen and Ranariddh.
